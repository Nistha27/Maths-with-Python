##  Gradient of a Vector 
The gradient of a vector is a mathematical concept that represents a vector containing the partial derivatives of a multivariable function with respect to each of its input variables. In other words, it quantifies how the function changes as you move in different directions in its input space.

## Divergence of Vector
The divergence of a vector field is a mathematical operation that represents a scalar quantity. It provides a measure of the rate at which the vector field's vectors spread out or converge at a given point in space. The divergence is often denoted by the symbol ∇· or div and is applied to a vector field V.

## Curl of Vector
The curl of a vector field is a mathematical operation that results in a vector quantity. It describes the rotation or circulation of a vector field at a specific point in space. The curl is often denoted by the symbol ∇× or curl and is applied to a vector field V.

## Greens Theoram 

Green's theorem is a fundamental theorem in vector calculus that relates line integrals around a closed curve to double integrals over the plane region enclosed by that curve. It is named after the British mathematician George Green and is a generalization of the two-dimensional version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

If P (x, y) and Q(x, y) be two continuous functions having continuous partial derivatives in a region R of the xy-plane,
bounded by a simple closed curve C,
